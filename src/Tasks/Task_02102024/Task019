// Write 5 points related to the Class and Objects.

   ♦ Class
        1. Class is not a real-world entity. It is just a template or blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
        2. Class does not occupy memory.
        3. Class is a group of variables of different data types and a group of methods.
        4. A Class in Java can contain:
            •Data member/ Attributes
            •Method/Member Function/ Function
            •Constructor
            •Nested Class
            •Interface


   ♠ Object
         ◘ An object in Java is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents real-life entities. Objects are the instances of a class that are created to use the attributes and methods of a class.
            A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods.

            ♠An object consists of :

            • State : It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
            • Behavior : It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.
            • Identity : It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.
